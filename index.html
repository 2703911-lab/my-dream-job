        </ul>
        <p><strong>University and Program:</strong> While not always required, a degree in criminal justice can improve my chances of getting hired and advancing. I could attend Arizona State University’s Bachelor’s in Criminology and Criminal Justice program, which offers courses in law enforcement, criminal law, and investigative techniques to prepare me for this career.</p>

        <h3>Average Salary</h3>
